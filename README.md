# React Webpack Starter
A boiler plate for creating react applications bundled by webpack

## Setting up
To run this project, youâ€™ll need to install the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You'll also need a global installation of webpack and the webpack development server 

```
npm i -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```

The dependencies of this project are managed with yarn (see installation guide [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)). However you can simply use the node package manager, npm for your dependency management.

## Installing Packages
+ For yarn
```
bash yarn install
```

+ NPM
```
bash npm install
```

## Running the app
Run `npm start` to intialize and run the webpack development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
